# Introduction - In this course, we will be going over the basic foundations of Artificial Intelligence with Python.
# Artificial Intelligence covers a wide variety of types of techniques.

# We will be exploring the concepts and algorithms at the at the heart of modern AI.

# First we will start with a look at how AI can search for solutions to problems, whether those problems are learning
#how to play a game or trying to find driving directions to a destination.

# We'll then look at how AI can represent information, both knowledge that our AI is certain about, but also 
#information and events about which our AI might be uncertain, learning how to represent that information, but more
#importantly, how to use that information to draw inferences and new conclusions as well.

# We'll explore how AI can solve various types of optimization problems, trying to maximize profits or minimize 
#costs or satisfy some other constraints before turning our attention to the fast-growing field of Machine Learning,
#where we won'ttell our AI exactly how to solve a problem, but instead, give our AI access to data and experiences
#so that our AI can learn on it's own how to perform these tasks.

# In particular, we will look at neural networks, one of the most popular tools in mordern machine learning, inspired
#by the way that human brains learn and reason as well.

# Finally, we will be diving into the world of Natural Language Processing, so that it's not just us humans learning
#to learn how artificial intelligence is able to speak, but also AI learning how to understand and interpret human
# language as well.

# We will explore these ideas and algorithms, and along the way, we will build our own AI programs to implement all
#of this and more.
