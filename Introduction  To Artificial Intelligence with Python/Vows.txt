Dear Mona Lia,

	I don't know where to begin or what words to use to try and get my point clearly across, but I'll try anyway. It has been almost two years, if not more, that I have been on that ass. I feel the distance between us closing, even though it seems to be moving at a snails pace at times, I can feel us drawing nearer everyday. 

What started out as a random shot in the dark, turned into the shot of a lifetime. Honestly, I'm feeling like Steph Curry these days. Who would have guessed that we'd be here. Not completely in each others presence where we belong, but so much further than when we started.

To be real with you, the more and more I write these words, the more and more I feel like this would make a great opening for my wedding vows. And I know, you like your privacy and secrecy and blah blah blah, lmao, that should make the wedding guest laugh, but seriously... 

I hope you've been out there saving something for Papi. Currently, this Thick is backed up more than a low pressure toilet at a shit hole motel. You will most DEFINITELY be getting pregnant after the first three strokes on our honeymoon night, so umm, yeah.

I don't wanna ramble on so I'll cut this short. But before I let you go, just know...
